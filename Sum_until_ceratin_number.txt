#Programmed by René Nicolás Quijada Romero

#This code receives a list as input. It will sum the numbers of the list until
# it is more than 9000. It uses the break function to stop a loop. 

#Reasoning ---------------------°°°-----------------------
#The sum has to continue while it is less than 9000, but when sum > 9000
#it has to <<stop>>.
