# Projects
This repository contains my programming projects mainly in Python language. It evolves from simple to complex programs. 

1)Physics: This program calculates certain physical values based on imputs such as mass or time. It produces outputs such as energy, force 
and other physical values.

2)Shipping: This program takes a weight as an input and based on certain prices written on a chart tells the customer the best offer that
he or she should take to ship their package, either through ground, drone service or premium ground service. It can be adapted to satisfy
any prices set by the person who runs the service. For the chart used specifically for this project check the PNG file.
